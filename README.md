# Timestamp Microservice

This is a simple Timestamp Microservice project, part of the FreeCodeCamp Back End Development and APIs certification. The goal is to accept a URL parameter 'date', which can be a date in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD' or a Unix timestamp. The service will respond with a JSON containing the Unix timestamp and the UTC date. If the parameter is empty, it will display the current Unix timestamp and UTC date. If the input is not valid, an error will be returned.

The main implementation for this task can be found in the index.js file.
